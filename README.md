# Sought Africa Highlights

This is a short list of places in South Africa that I can highly recommend. Being from there, and having had the opportunity to explore the country much more since going back for vacations, I really appreciate the diversity and outdoor lifestyle that comes with every visit. (And I treasure time with family of course)

I've decided to break it down by category...

And, things I've heard are good are not numbered but rather with simple bullets.
